# Prompt templates for LLM orchestration
report_system_prompt: |
  You are a supply-chain risk analyst. Summarise the hazard findings
  for the given company and its supplier network. Reference evidence
  items using [E1], [E2], etc.

company_profile_prompt: |
  Given the company "{company}", identify:
  - canonical_name: The full official company name
  - industry: Primary industry sector (e.g., "Consumer Electronics", "Automotive Manufacturing")
  - products: 2-5 main product lines or services
  - headquarters: City, country of corporate headquarters
  - description: One-sentence company description

  Use public knowledge. If uncertain, note that in the description.

tier_expansion_prompt: |
  Given the company "{company}" in the {industry} industry (products: {products}),
  identify plausible tier-{tier} suppliers.

  For each supplier, provide:
  - name: The company name
  - lat / lon: Latitude and longitude of their primary facility
  - location_description: City and country (e.g., "Hsinchu, Taiwan")
  - confidence: How confident you are (0-1) that this is a real supplier relationship
  - rationale: Why this company is a plausible supplier, citing public knowledge
  - industry: The supplier's industry sector
  - product_category: What they supply to the parent (e.g., "Silicon wafers", "Raw steel")
  - relationship_type: One of: raw_material, component, service, logistics

  Focus on major, well-known suppliers based on public knowledge.
  If you are uncertain, reflect that in a lower confidence score.
  Return between 2 and 6 suppliers.

mitigation_prompt: |
  You are a supply-chain resilience expert. Given the company "{company}"
  and the hazard assessment data below, generate concrete mitigation
  strategies for every supplier-hazard pair rated Medium or High.

  {risk_context}

  For each affected supplier-hazard pair, provide:
  - supplier_name: Exact supplier name from the data
  - hazard_type: Exact hazard type from the data
  - level: The risk level (Medium or High)
  - actions: 2-3 specific, implementable mitigation steps tailored to
    the supplier's location and the hazard severity. Reference the actual
    score data (e.g. "1,072 M4+ earthquakes recorded") when relevant.
  - priority: P1 (act within 48 hours), P2 (act within 2 weeks),
    P3 (ongoing monitoring). Assign P1 to High hazards, P2 to Medium.
  - rationale: A one-sentence explanation citing the specific score and
    location data that justifies these actions.

  Focus on practical, cost-effective recommendations. Consider the
  supplier's geographic location when suggesting alternatives.
  Do NOT generate mitigations for Low-rated hazards.

suggest_alternatives_prompt: |
  You are a supply-chain diversification specialist. Given the company "{company}"
  and the hazard assessment data below, suggest alternative suppliers for
  the highest-risk suppliers to reduce overall supply-chain risk.

  {risk_context}

  For each supplier with a composite risk score >= 0.5 or any critical threshold
  alert, suggest 2-3 alternative suppliers located in regions with lower exposure
  to the dominant hazard. For each alternative, provide:
  - name: A plausible real company name in the same industry
  - lat / lon: Facility location in a lower-hazard region
  - confidence: How viable this alternative is as a replacement (0-1)
  - rationale: Why this location reduces exposure to the specific hazard

  Ground your suggestions in geographic hazard knowledge. For example, avoid the
  Pacific Ring of Fire for earthquake risk, avoid low-lying river basins for
  flood risk, and prefer temperate inland regions for cyclone risk.

  Only suggest alternatives for suppliers rated Medium or High risk overall.
  Do NOT suggest alternatives for Low-risk suppliers.
